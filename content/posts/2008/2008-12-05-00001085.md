<p>
      But the dangerous thing about always doing the popular thing is that you let go of your responsibility to make sure everything goes through YOU first, before you make any decisions and you begin to rely on others too much to make the decisions for you.

<p>
      And the longer this goes on, the harder it becomes for you to truly do what you want to do when the time comes.
</p>

<p>
      Don&#8217;t give up your internal thinking and leave it up to people outside of you.
