Putting All Your Eggs in One Basket &#8211; BrianKim.net</a>」では、若い頃に選択と集中をして、何かに取り組むことの重要性について書いていました。若いときに何かに集中して、そこで遭遇したリスクを通してしか得られないものがあるというようなお話。

      When it comes to the dilemma of putting all your eggs in one basket, you&#8217;ll often hear this famous quote get introduced into the discussion:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
        Concentrate your energies, your thoughts and your capital. The wise man puts all his eggs in one basket and watches the basket. &#8211; Andrew Carnegie
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
      I agree with that statement and I just want to add one more aspect to it.
</p>

<p>
      When you&#8217;re FIRST starting out, put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket carefully.
</p>

<p>
      THEN, you can diversify accordingly after you learn from all the experience that has given you.
</p>

<p>
      What you&#8217;ll find is that when you put all your eggs in one basket in the beginning, when you risk&#8217; early on, you gain much more &#8220;concentrated&#8221; value, win or lose and with that, you find it easier to reduce the risk later on.
</p>

<p>
      But if you live your life in fear and try to reduce risk early on, you&#8217;ll never gain any &#8220;concentrated&#8221; value in the form of experiences and lessons that only through risk will you TRULY be able to learn.
</p>

<p>
      So put those eggs in that one basket when you first start out.
</p>

<p>
      Watch that basket carefully.
</p>

<p>
      Regardless of the outcome, you will learn valuable &#8220;concentrated&#8221; lessons either way.
</p>
