    　Paul Grahamのサイトで&#8221;The hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn&#8221;が公開されました。気になった部分について載せておきます。

      Users hate bugs, but they don&#8217;t seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there&#8217;s more coming soon.<br /> （bugsがあるのは論外だけれども、最小のversion 1であれば受け入れる。論文にたとえれば、根本的な事実誤認はあり得ないけれど、発展が見込めるものであればとりあえずはOK…ということか？）
</li>

      Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that it makes you work harder. When you&#8217;re working on something that isn&#8217;t released, problems are intriguing. In something that&#8217;s out there, problems are alarming. There is a lot more urgency once you release. And I think that&#8217;s precisely why people put it off. They know they&#8217;ll have to work a lot harder once they do.<br /> （困難な問題に取り組むのを嫌がっている可能性を常に疑っておくべき）

      As with exercise, improvements beget improvements. If you run every day, you&#8217;ll probably feel like running tomorrow. But if you skip running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself out. So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more ideas you&#8217;ll have. You should make your system better at least in some small way every day or two.<br /> （常に改善することを考えよ）
</li>
<li>
      They&#8217;ll like you even better when you improve in response to their comments, because customers are used to companies ignoring them. If you&#8217;re the rare exception&#8211; a company that actually listens&#8211; you&#8217;ll generate fanatical loyalty. You won&#8217;t need to advertise, because your users will do it for you.<br /> （何らかの反応をしてくれた人の話は謙虚に耳を傾けるべき。）

      If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations: (a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination. Experience suggests (b) is a thousand times more likely.<br /> （もうこれ以上考えられないというときは、想像力が欠けていると思った方がよい）
</li>
<li>
      The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you&#8217;ve got, right away. If you have something impressive, try to put it on the front page, because that&#8217;s the only one most visitors will see. Though indeed there&#8217;s a paradox here: the more you push the good stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore further.<br /> （自分の印象に強く残ったものをいつも語るようにすべき）
</li>
<li>
      As Richard Feynman said, the imagination of nature is greater than the imagination of man. You&#8217;ll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking. This principle is very powerful. It&#8217;s why the best abstract painting still falls short of Leonardo, for example. And it applies to startups too. No idea for a product could ever be so clever as the ones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam of users.<br /> （つねにusersが求めるものを作り続けること）
