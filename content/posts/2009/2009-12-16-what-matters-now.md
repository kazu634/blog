      There&#8217;s never really a great way to apologize, but there are plenty of terrible ways.
</p>

<p>
      If you&#8217;re at a coffee shop, and you spill coffee on someone by accident, what do you say? You&#8217;ll likely say &#8220;Oh my god, I&#8217;m so sorry!&#8221; When you mean it you say you&#8217;re sorry &#8211; it&#8217;s a primal response. You wouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;Oh my god, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused!&#8221; But that&#8217;s exactly how most companies respond when they make a big mistake.
</p>

<p>
      Mistakes happen. How you apologize matters. Don&#8217;t bullshit people &#8211; just say &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221;. And mean it.
