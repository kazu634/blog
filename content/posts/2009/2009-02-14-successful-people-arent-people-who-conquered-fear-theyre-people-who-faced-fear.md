      But here&#8217;s the secret most people don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s a secret that most successful people know. You don&#8217;t actually have to &#8220;conquer&#8221; fear. You have to master it. Mark Twain once said, &#8220;Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear &#8211; not absence of fear.&#8221; Successful people aren&#8217;t people who conquered fear, they&#8217;re people who faced fear. They&#8217;re people who were afraid and did it anyway.
