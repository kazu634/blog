      In my work I go around the world giving keynote talks on leadership and innovation and I often address large, prestigious audiences. Part of the reason that I can do that is because one teacher took the initiative and gave me a challenge. He asked me to do something I had never done and helped me to learn how to do it.

      Education is not about league tables or exam results. It is about opening doors for people and showing them rooms that that would otherwise be hidden. If we can challenge children to try things and to learn what they can achieve then maybe one day we will be remembered with the gratitude that I hold for Mr Priestley.
