      So far as I know,&#160;&#160; &#160;<br /> <blockquote>
        so<br /> far as I know, and I&#8217;ve been told by others, much of what I say applies<br /> to many fields. Outstanding work is characterized very much the same<br /> way in most fields[.]&#160;&#160; &#160;</p>

            One of the characteristics&#160;&#160; &#160;<br /> <blockquote>
              One<br /> of the characteristics you see, and many people have it including great<br /> scientists, is that usually when they were young they had independent<br /> thoughts and had the courage to pursue them.&#160;&#160; &#160;</p>

                    One<br /> of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage. Once<br /> you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems,<br /> then you can. If you think you can&#8217;t, almost surely you are not going<br /> to.&#160;&#160; &#160;</p>

                        What most people think are the best working conditions&#160;&#160; &#160;<br /> <blockquote>
                          What<br /> most people think are the best working conditions, are not. Very<br /> clearly they are not because people are often most productive when<br /> working conditions are bad.&#160;&#160; &#160;</p>

                              What appears to be a fault&#160;&#160; &#160;<br /> <blockquote>
                                What<br /> appears to be a fault, often, by a change of viewpoint, turns out to be<br /> one of the greatest assets you can have.&#160;&#160; &#160;</p>

                                            On<br /> this matter of drive Edison says, &#8220;Genius is 99% perspiration and 1%<br /> inspiration.&#8221; He may have been exaggerating, but the idea is that solid<br /> work, steadily applied, gets you surprisingly far. The steady<br /> application of effort with a little bit more work, intelligently<br /> applied is what does it. That&#8217;s the trouble; drive, misapplied, doesn&#8217;t<br /> get you anywhere. I&#8217;ve often wondered why so many of my good friends at<br /> Bell Labs who worked as hard or harder than I did, didn&#8217;t have so much<br /> to show for it. The misapplication of effort is a very serious matter.<br /> Just hard work is not enough &#8211; it must be applied sensibly.&#160;&#160;<br /> &#160;</p>

It isn&#8217;t just a matter of the job, it&#8217;s the way you write<br /> the report, the way you write the paper, the whole attitude. It&#8217;s just<br /> as easy to do a broad, general job as one very special case. And it&#8217;s<br /> much more satisfying and rewarding!&#160;&#160; &#160;</p>

The people who do great<br /> work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that<br /> those who have great skill and dabble in it, who work during the day<br /> and go home and do other things and come back and work the next day.<br /> They don&#8217;t have the deep commitment that is apparently necessary for<br /> really first-class work. They turn out lots of good work, but we were<br /> talking, remember, about first-class work. There is a difference. Good<br /> people, very talented people, almost always turn out good work. We&#8217;re<br /> talking about the outstanding work, the type of work that gets the<br /> Nobel Prize and gets recognition.&#160;&#160; &#160;</p>
