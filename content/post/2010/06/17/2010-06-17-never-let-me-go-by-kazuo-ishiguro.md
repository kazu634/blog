    Kazuo Ishiguro&#8217;s novel <i>Never Let Me Go</i> is turned into a movie. This news remind me of the times when I was a student.
</p>
  
<p>
    When I was a post graduate student (master&#8217;s course) for English literature, I read <i>Never Let Me Go</i>. Kazuo Ishiguro uses the blend of the traditional unreliable narrator and the narrative strategy for the detective story, I think. What do I mean the narrative strategy for the detective story? I mean, as the readers go on reading and he/she reaches the last page of the novel, his/her understanding of the whole affairs become clearer and clearer. And of course, Kazuo Ishiguro uses the SF element as well in this novel.

    When I was a 1st grade in master&#8217;s course, I wanted to be a professional researcher. But a series of bad accidents befalls my family (especially my dad and mom), and finally my dad becomes sick. As my parents were against my will to become a professional researcher and the fact that my dad becomes sick after the series of bad accidents has so important meaning to me (I was a 1st son of my parents), I finally decided to abandon my ambition to become a researcher.

    Looking back, I&#8217;m not sure whether my decision is the best decision I can made at that time. Two of my friends acquires the academic jobs. If I had continued studying, I could acuire&#8230; All I can say is that I am happy now.
