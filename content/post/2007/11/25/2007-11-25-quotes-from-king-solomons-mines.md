      But mindful of the results of over-feeding on starving stomachs, we were careful not to eat too much, stopping whilst we were still hungry. (67)

      When they had given us this information our visitors bade us good night; and, having arranged to watch turn and turn about, three of us flung ourselves down and slept the sweet sleep of the weary, whilst the fourth sat up on the look-out for possible treachery. (84)

      `Tell him,&#8217; answered Sir Henry `that he mistakes an Englishmen. Wealth is good, and if it comes in our way we will take it; but a gentleman does not sell himself for wealth. But speaking for myself, I say this. I have always liked Umbopa, and so far as lies in me will stand by him in this business. It will be very pleasant to me to try and square matters with that cruel devil, Twala. What do you say, Good, and you, Quatermain?&#8217; (98)

      This made me very angry, for if possible to avoid it. I hate to miss in public. When one can only do one thing well, one likes to keep up one&#8217;s reputation in that thing. Move quite out of myself at my failure, I did a rash thing. Rapidly covering the general as he ran, I let drive with the second barrel. The poor man threw up his arms, and fell forward on to his face. This time I had made no mistake; and &#8212; I say it as a proof of how little we think of others when our own pride or reputation are in question &#8212; I was brute enough to feel delighted at the sight.

<blockquote>
<p>
      `Thou hearest, Incubum&#8217; said Ignnosi to Sir Henry, `He has not been here.&#8217;
</p>
    
<p>
      `Well, well,&#8217; said Sir Henry, with a sigh; `There it is: I suppose he never get here. Poor fellow, poor fellow! So it has all been for nothing. God&#8217;s will be done.&#8217;

      `Now for business,&#8217; I put in, anxious to escape from a painful subject. (99)

    the authority of gentlemen
</h4>
  
<blockquote>
<p>
      `It is strange,&#8217; he answered, `and had ye not been Englishmen I would not have believed it; but English &#8220;gentlemen&#8221; tell no lies. If we live through the matter, be sure I will repay ye! (110)

<h4>
    Superior position of Whites
</h4>
  
<blockquote>
<p>
      `This: that if you ever come to be king of this people you will do away with the smelling out of witches such as we have seen last night; and that the killing of men without trial shall not take place in the land.&#8217;
</p>
    
<p>
      Ignosi thought for a moment, after I had translated this, and then answered &#8212;
</p>
    
<p>
      `The ways of black people are not as the ways of white men, Incubu, nor do we hold life so high as yet. Yet will I promise it. If it be my power to hold them back, the witch-finders shall hunt no more, nor shall any man die the death without judgment.&#8217; (110)
