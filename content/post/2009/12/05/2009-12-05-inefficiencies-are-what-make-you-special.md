      Often, the &#8220;wrong&#8221; things you choose to do are what set you apart and make your product unique. They’re the spice that make your dish special.

      Adria&#8217;s idea is that if you listen to customers, what they tell you they want will be based on something they already know. If I like a good steak, you can serve that to me, and I&#8217;ll enjoy it. But it will never be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. To create those experiences, you almost can’t listen to the customer&#8230;Adria says he doesn&#8217;t listen to customers, yet his customers are some of the most satisfied in the world. That&#8217;s an interesting riddle to consider.
